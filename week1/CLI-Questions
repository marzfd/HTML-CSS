1. How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
>>> To make a file/folder hidden, add a dot "." at the beginning of its name.
>>> To display it in the CLI, enter "ls -a" command.


2. How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?
>>> Enter the code "mkdir -p /myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun" command in the CLI.


3. How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:
first message
second message
>>> Enter 'echo "first message" >> CLI.txt" and 'echo "second message" >> CLI.txt'.
